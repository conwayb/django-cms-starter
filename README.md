django-cms-starter
==================

a minimal starter project for django-cms 
--to alleviate intall effort
--this is not setup for real development/production just tinkering:
-- i don't really know what i'm doing so there may be weird broken stuff.
use pip install requirements.txt to install django and django-cms and all other requirements
this is setup with a sqlite database--for tinkering purposes only
there is nothing in local_settings.py
only the text plugin (tinymce) is added in INSTALLED APPS
change directory structure as you see fit
create yourself a superuser or guess my username/password
